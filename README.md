Convert JSON to SASS!

It might sound weird. But how many times do you need to access some variable which you've stored in a SCSS file in your JavaScript? Won't be it great if you could share the same variables in JavaScript and SCSS?

With this library, you can store your variables in JSON and convert it to SCSS just before building the files.
